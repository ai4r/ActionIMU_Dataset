Data were collected from 47 subjects in their 20s (22 males, 25 females) in the living laboratory. A total of 48 everyday indoor actions are given and the actions were classified into 7 categories based on real-life observations \cite{jang2020etri}- {\it meals, grooming, household duties, hobbies, healthcare, interaction with others, and human-robot interaction}. Subjects performed the same actions multiple times in various situations. Subjects were able to do it in their own way with minimal restrictions on position or posture. In addition, since it was recorded from the perspective of a personal service robot, data were collected from various viewpoints such as front, side, and rear.
